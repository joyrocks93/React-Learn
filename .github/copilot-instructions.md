# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This project is a learning workspace for foundational web development and React concepts. It is organized as a series of step-by-step exercises and notes, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React fundamentals. The structure is intentionally simple to support incremental learning and experimentation.

## Structure & Key Files
- `Basic/` — Contains HTML, JS, and notes for early exercises (e.g., forms, layout, JS basics).
  - `index.html` — Main HTML file for hands-on tasks (e.g., form creation).
  - `index.js` — JavaScript file for DOM or React practice (currently empty, ready for exercises).
  - `Notes.txt` — Step-by-step roadmap for learning web basics before React.
- `Notes.txt` (root) — High-level React learning path, outlining phases and key concepts.

## Developer Workflow
- No build tools or package managers are present yet. All code runs directly in the browser.
- To test changes, open `Basic/index.html` in a browser. Link `index.js` as needed for JS exercises.
- Follow the learning roadmap in `Notes.txt` files for the intended progression.
- When React is introduced, expect a new project structure (e.g., via Vite or Create React App).

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Each exercise is self-contained; keep code simple and focused on the current topic.
- Use clear, minimal HTML/CSS/JS — avoid frameworks or advanced patterns until introduced in the notes.
- Document learning steps and solutions in the relevant `Notes.txt` for future reference.
- When adding React, follow the structure and setup described in the root `Notes.txt`.

## Examples
- For a form exercise, add the form structure to `index.html` and any JS logic to `index.js`.
- For a JS array task, write the function in `index.js` and reference the task in `Notes.txt`.

## Integration Points
- No external dependencies or APIs are used at this stage.
- When React is added, follow the setup instructions in the root `Notes.txt`.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Prioritize clarity and simplicity in all code and explanations.
- Reference the appropriate `Notes.txt` for context before making changes.
- Do not introduce tools, libraries, or patterns not yet covered in the learning path.
- If expanding the project (e.g., adding React), update this file with new conventions and workflows.
